# Rotational IR Distance Scanner using MSP430 and Sharp GP2D12

This project implements a low-cost 2D scanning LiDAR system using a Sharp GP2D12 analog infrared rangefinder, a continuous rotation servo (SPT5525LV-360), and an MSP430F5529 microcontroller. It reads analog voltage values corresponding to distances, transmits them via UART, and visualizes them in real time on a host PC.


 Created as part of a final lab project in PHYS 319 at the University of British Columbia
